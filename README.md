# GPTW-dataviz
Visual data exploratory enviroment using GPTW Australia's publicly available data.
This is my capstone project for Bachelor of BA.

Download the pbix file and use the exploratory guide to assist in using the dashboards.

The dashboards are designed to cater for 3 different stakeholders who can benefit from GPTW Australia's public data, including: A recent BA grad, an international job-seeker interested in moving to Australia, and GPTW's business developemnt officier. More details on these user personas and insights/recommendations for each one could be found in the guide.
